Upipe is a flexible dataflow framework. It is primarily designed to be the
core of a multimedia player, transcoder or streamer. The framework organizes
the processing of incoming data buffer inside a pipeline of modules. It
exposes core types for buffers and modules (called "pipes"), and the API of
communication between pipes and between the application and pipes.

The API documentation is written as a mkdoc file. Install mkdoc
(http://www.nongnu.org/mkdoc/) and type
        ./configure && make doc
